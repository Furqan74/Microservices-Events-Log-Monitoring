# INTRODUCTION:​
​AN OPEN-SOURCE PLATFORM CALLED KUBERNETES IS USED TO MANAGE CONTAINER TECHNOLOGIES LIKE DOCKER.  ​
USING DOCKER, YOU MAY BUILD CONTAINERS FOR AN APPLICATION AND IMAGE THAT ARE ALREADY SETUP. THE NEXT STAGE IS PROVIDED BY KUBERNETES, WHICH ENABLES YOU TO RUN NUMEROUS CONTAINERS ACROSS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS AND DISTRIBUTE LOADS ACROSS THEM.   ​
AN OPEN-SOURCE PLATFORM CALLED KUBERNETES, OR K8S, IS USED TO AUTOMATE THE DEPLOYMENT, SCALING, AND MANAGEMENT OF CONTAINERIZED APPLICATIONS.  ​

# MONITORING THROUGH DIRECT MEANS:​
​DIRECT MONITORING IS THE PROCESS OF SEEING AND ANALYZING CERTAIN METRICS, LOGS, AND EVENTS PRODUCED BY MICRO SERVICES IN REAL-TIME IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THEIR PERFORMANCE BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY. THIS METHOD FOCUSES SPECIFICALLY ON KEEPING AN EYE ON THE INTERNAL STATUS AND ACTIONS OF MICRO SERVICES IN A DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM.​
DIRECT MONITORING PROVIDES ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MICRO SERVICES OPERATE INTERNALLY, WHICH HELPS IDENTIFY THE CORE SOURCE OF PROBLEMS.​
IMMEDIATE ACTION: SINCE DIRECT MONITORING IS REAL-TIME, MISTAKES OR PERFORMANCE ANOMALIES CAN BE QUICKLY IDENTIFIED AND ADDRESSED.​

# MONITORING THROUGH INDIRECT MEANS:​
​BY FOCUSING ON THE EXTERIOR RESULTS AND INTERACTIONS RATHER THAN DIGGING INTO THE INNER WORKINGS OF INDIVIDUAL MICRO SERVICES, INDIRECT MONITORING EVALUATES THE BEHAVIOR AND PERFORMANCE OF MICRO SERVICES. IT FOCUSES ON HOW REQUESTS AND RESPONSES MOVE ACROSS A DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM FROM BEGINNING TO END.​
BY MONITORING THE FLOW OF REQUESTS ACROSS MICRO SERVICES, IT ASSISTS IN LOCATING LATENCY PROBLEMS AND PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS.​

# OUR CONTRIBUTION​
# SETUP KUBERNETES / DOCKER​
​
​REQUIREMENTS:​
USER ACCOUNTS WITH ROOT OR SUDO CAPABILITIES ON EACH SYSTEM  ​
BY DEFAULT, THE APT PACKAGE MANAGER IS INCLUDED.​
TWO OR MORE LINUX SERVERS OPERATING ON UBUNTU 20.0   ​
THE TERMINAL WINDOW OR COMMAND LINE (CTRL-ALT-T)  ​

# ​STEPS INVOLVE IN OUR SETUP FOR MONITORING​
​
- INSTALL KUBERNETES ON UBUNTU & DOCKER INSTALLATION​
- MINIKUBE INSTALLATION​
- KUBECTL INSTALLATION ​
- TRAEFIK​
- KUBERNETES MONITORING OF TRAEFIK LOGS WITH 3 DIFFERENT TOOLS​

# KUBERNETES MONITORING OF TRAEFIK LOGS WITH PROMETHEUS​
​OVERVIEW​:
IN OUR MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE HOSTED ON KUBERNETES, WE IMPLEMENTED A ROBUST MONITORING SOLUTION TO TRACK TRAEFIK LOGS USING PROMETHEUS. THIS INTEGRATION ALLOWS US TO GAIN INSIGHTS INTO THE PERFORMANCE, TRAFFIC, AND POTENTIAL ISSUES WITHIN OUR TRAEFIK PROXY.​

TOOLS USED​:
TRAEFIK: A POWERFUL AND DYNAMIC REVERSE PROXY AND LOAD BALANCER THAT MANAGES INCOMING TRAFFIC TO OUR SERVICES IN THE KUBERNETES CLUSTER.​

PROMETHEUS: ​
AN OPEN-SOURCE MONITORING AND ALERTING TOOLKIT DESIGNED FOR RELIABILITY AND SCALABILITY. PROMETHEUS COLLECTS AND STORES TIME-SERIES DATA, MAKING IT A VALUABLE TOOL FOR MONITORING.​

CONCLUSION​
BY MONITORING TRAEFIK LOGS WITH PROMETHEUS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A COMPREHENSIVE MONITORING SOLUTION THAT PROVIDES VISIBILITY INTO THE BEHAVIOR AND PERFORMANCE OF TRAEFIK WITHIN OUR KUBERNETES ENVIRONMENT. THIS SETUP ENHANCES OUR ABILITY TO TROUBLESHOOT ISSUES, OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE, AND ENSURE THE RELIABILITY OF OUR MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE.​
