# INTRODUCTION:​
​AN OPEN-SOURCE PLATFORM CALLED KUBERNETES IS USED TO MANAGE CONTAINER TECHNOLOGIES LIKE DOCKER.  ​
USING DOCKER, YOU MAY BUILD CONTAINERS FOR AN APPLICATION AND IMAGE THAT ARE ALREADY SETUP. THE NEXT STAGE IS PROVIDED BY KUBERNETES, WHICH ENABLES YOU TO RUN NUMEROUS CONTAINERS ACROSS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS AND DISTRIBUTE LOADS ACROSS THEM.   ​
AN OPEN-SOURCE PLATFORM CALLED KUBERNETES, OR K8S, IS USED TO AUTOMATE THE DEPLOYMENT, SCALING, AND MANAGEMENT OF CONTAINERIZED APPLICATIONS.  ​

# MONITORING THROUGH DIRECT MEANS:​
​DIRECT MONITORING IS THE PROCESS OF SEEING AND ANALYZING CERTAIN METRICS, LOGS, AND EVENTS PRODUCED BY MICRO SERVICES IN REAL-TIME IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THEIR PERFORMANCE BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY. THIS METHOD FOCUSES SPECIFICALLY ON KEEPING AN EYE ON THE INTERNAL STATUS AND ACTIONS OF MICRO SERVICES IN A DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM.​
DIRECT MONITORING PROVIDES ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MICRO SERVICES OPERATE INTERNALLY, WHICH HELPS IDENTIFY THE CORE SOURCE OF PROBLEMS.​
IMMEDIATE ACTION: SINCE DIRECT MONITORING IS REAL-TIME, MISTAKES OR PERFORMANCE ANOMALIES CAN BE QUICKLY IDENTIFIED AND ADDRESSED.​

# MONITORING THROUGH INDIRECT MEANS:​
​BY FOCUSING ON THE EXTERIOR RESULTS AND INTERACTIONS RATHER THAN DIGGING INTO THE INNER WORKINGS OF INDIVIDUAL MICRO SERVICES, INDIRECT MONITORING EVALUATES THE BEHAVIOR AND PERFORMANCE OF MICRO SERVICES. IT FOCUSES ON HOW REQUESTS AND RESPONSES MOVE ACROSS A DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM FROM BEGINNING TO END.​
BY MONITORING THE FLOW OF REQUESTS ACROSS MICRO SERVICES, IT ASSISTS IN LOCATING LATENCY PROBLEMS AND PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS.​
